  The real-world arena used for the Turtlebot consists of 10 destinations and the IAN hub. 
  For each hub-to-point-of-interest journey, 20 tests were carried out to measure the time taken 
  for the Turtlebot to travel (after receiving the command to move to the destination) from its hub to 
  the specified destination. We then calculated the average of the travel times for each journey, 
  and plotted the deviation of each test from its respective average journey time. From the analysis, we can deduce 
  that most of the travel times for each journey deviate from their respective averages in the margin of 5%. 
  Thus, we can conclude that the travel times, given the distances and their average journey times, for each journey are consistent. 
  For passengers to trust our product in a real-world scenario, we need to ensure that it is reliable and capable of carrying them to their destination on time.

<p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:2%;  width:40%; ">
Another feature we wanted to evaluate was the accuracy of the Turtlebot's final position (coordinates given in the database) from the actual, tested 
final position for each journey. For each hub-to-point-of-interest journey, 20 tests were carried out. When the turtlebot reached the destination, 
we recorded its position and calculated the difference between the given coordinates and the actual coordinates. <b>Note that the distance the Turtlebot 
traveled was between 1.5m to 5.5m</b>. During our navigation parameter tuning, we manually allowed the Turtlebot a tolerance of 25cm to reach the 
destination (using the <i>xy_goal_tolerance</i> parameter), meaning that within a 25cm radius of the given coordinates the Turtlebot would stop and 
assume it has reached its destination. Our measurements show that the <i>maximum difference in disparity we get is 5cm</i>, which we deem to be acceptable. 
In a real-world scenario, our product will be scaled up meaning that these measurements will change. However, we estimate that the accuracy of 
the localization of the Turtlebot will not, as the same principles will be used even if the distance travelled is larger.

  margin-right: auto;">For our final demo, we planned on including a footrest for the passengers, 
as well as focussing on aesthetics such as covering for the armrests, cushioning for the chair 
and wire concealment. We also planned to include text-to-speech features and warning lights 
to alert other passengers who may come in the way of the system. We estimate that this would 
cost an additional £20 - £25.

  We met at the beginning of each sprint. 
  We would break down the milestones of the sprint into tasks, 
  and would arrange ourselves into teams depending on the ongoing tasks. 
  Using Trello, individuals were assigned those tasks.
  Most teams remained the same across various sprints and some teams were rearranged when needed. 
   </p>
   <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%; width:23% ">
   At the end of each sprint, each team wrote a Nuclino page with instructions on how they accomplished their tasks and problems they faced, 
   alongisde their solutions and likely causes. This is so if members of a team would become unavailable at some point in the future, 
   other members of the group can build on top of what it's already built with the already-existing work fully documented. </p>

   <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%;   width:23%">
   Team meetings and meetings with the mentor took place on a weekly basis. 
   To keep every member of the team up to date with other members' work, the team had daily scrums over Slack. 
   The 'scrum window' would last for 2 hours. In this window, each member writes what they have done since the last scrum, 
   what they are currently working on and what they'll work on next. Daily scrums allowed all members of the team to be aware of 
   occuring problems immediately, instead of delaying problems to the weekly meetings. 

   </p>
   <p class="w3-quarter " style="margin:1%; width:23%">
   Development tools used included git to manage the working files, which were maintained on a Github repository. 
   Trello was also used to assign tasks and deadlines to each member at the beginning of each sprint. 
   Slack was used for daily communication.
